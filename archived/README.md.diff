 The following requirements apply:
   * The repo must exist; it is not created by the bot. It is recommended that an empty new repo is used.
 If the repo is of public interest, it can be requested to be moved into the [`feedarchive`](https://github.com/feedarchive) organization by filing an issue.
   * The GitHub user must have access to write to the repo. It is recommended that a dedicated new service account be used, not your primary user account.
-  * A GitHub [personal access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) is required with access to the entire `repo` and `gist` scopes.

-Depending on the number of results, the search can take a few seconds to two minutes.
-The maximum number of results returned for a search is 500.
